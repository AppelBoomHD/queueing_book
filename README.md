# Analysis of queueing systems with sample paths and simulation. 

The most important file is **queueing_book.pdf**, which contains the text and the most important exercises on my course on queueing theory.
The **companion.pdf** is a superset of the **queueing_book.pdf** in that it contains many more extra exercises (which I use for inspration for the exams), old exam questions, and hints and solutions for all exercises.

Comments are more than welcome of course: `n.d.van.foreest@rug.nl`.

* ``tex_files/`` source files for the text
* ``progs/``  programs, mainly python, to make the graphs and the simulations
* ``figures/`` the figures read by the latex files
  

To make the book, run:

* pdflatex queueing_book
* pythontex queueing_book
* pdflatex queueing_book


Here are the tools I use to make the text and the figures:

* latex: https://www.latex-project.org/
* pythontex: https://github.com/gpoore/pythontex/
* Python: http://www.python.org/
* numpy: http://www.numpy.org/
* Scipy: http://www.scipy.org/_
