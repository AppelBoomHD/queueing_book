In manufacturing settings it is quite often the case that the arrival process at a station is not a Poisson process.
For instance, if processing times at a station are nearly constant, and the jobs of this station are sent to a second station for further processing, the inter-arrival times at the second station must be more or less equal too.
Hence, in this case, the SCV of the arrivals at the second station $C_{a,2}^2$ is most probably smaller than 1.
%As a consequence the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula for the $M/G/1$ queue can no longer be reliably used to compute the average waiting times.
As a second, trivial case, if the inter-arrival times of jobs are 1 hour always and service times 59 minutes always, there simply cannot be a queue.
Thus, the $M/G/1$ waiting time formula should not be naively applied to approximate the average waiting time of the $G/G/1$ queue.

While there is no closed-form expression available to compute the expected waiting time in queue for the $G/G/c$ queue, Sakasegawa's formula provides a reasonable approximation. This takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:7}
  \E{W_Q} = \frac{C_a^2+C_s^2}2 \frac{\rho^{\sqrt{2(c+1)}-1}}{c(1-\rho)} \frac{\E S}c,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
  \rho = \frac{\lambda \E S}{c}
\end{equation*}
is the load of the station (but not of the individual machines) and $C_a^2 = \V X/(\E X)^2$ is the SCV of the inter-arrival times.
This formula is reasonably accurate; for related expressions we refer to \citet{bolch06:_queuein_networ_markov_chain} and \citet{hall91:_queuein_method_servic_manuf}.


It is crucial to memorize the \emph{scaling} relations that can be obtained from the $G/G/c$ waiting time formula.
Even though the above results are only approximations, they prove to be exceedingly useful when designing queueing systems and analyzing the effect of certain changes, in particular changes in capacity, variability and service times.
Roughly:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\E{W_Q} \sim (1-\rho)^{-1}$. The consequence is that the waiting
  time increases \emph{very steeply} when~$\rho$ is large. Hence, the waiting time is
  very sensitive to the actual value of $\rho$ when $\rho$ is large.
\item $\E{W_Q} \sim C_a^2$ and $\E{W_Q} \sim C_s^2$.
  Hence, reductions of the variation of the inter-arrival and service times do affect the waiting time, but only linearly.
\item $\E{W_Q} \sim \E S/c$.
  Thus, working in smaller job sizes reduces the waiting time as well.
  The average queue length does not decrease by working with smaller batches, but jobs are more `uniformly spread' over the queue.
  This effect lies behind the idea of `lot-splitting', i.e., rather than process large jobs, split jobs into multiple small jobs (assuming that setup times are negligible), so that the waiting time per job can be reduced.
\end{enumerate}

These insights prove very useful when trying to reduce waiting times in any practical situation.
First try to reduce the load (by blocking demand or increasing the capacity), then try to reduce the variability (e.g., by planning the arrival times of jobs), and finally, attempt to split jobs into multiple smaller jobs and use the resulting freedom to reschedule jobs in the queue.




\begin{exercise}\clabel{ex:l-184}
  Show that the approximation~\cref{eq:7} reduces to the result known for the $M/M/1$ and $M/G/1$ queues.
\begin{hint}
 Take $c=1$.
\end{hint}
\begin{solution}
    If $c=1$, as is the case for the $M/M/1$ queue, $\sqrt{2(c+1)} - 1=2-1=1$, so that~\cref{eq:7} reduces to $\E{W_Q} = \rho/(1-\rho) \E S$. Recall that $C_a^2=C_s^2=1$ for the $M/M/1$. 
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}


\begin{extra}
  Is~\cref{eq:24} also valid for the $G/G/1$ queue? Why (not)?
\begin{solution}
    Not necessarily.
    Since jobs do not arrive in general as a Poisson process, we cannot use the PASTA property to conclude that the time average queue length $\E{L_Q}$ is the same as the average queue length as observed by customers.
    (Can you provide an example that shows this difference?
    Hint, we did this earlier.)
\end{solution}
\end{extra}

\begin{exercise}\clabel{ex:l-185}
  Consider a queue with $c$ servers, with generally distributed inter-arrival times, generally distributed service times, and the system can contain at most $K$ customers, i.e., the $G/G/c/K$ queue.
  Let $\lambda$ be the arrival rate, $\mu$ the service rate, $\beta$ the long-run fraction of customers lost, and $\rho$ the average number of busy/occupied servers.
  Show that
  \begin{equation*}
    \beta = 1 - \rho\frac{\mu}{\lambda}.
  \end{equation*}
\begin{solution}
  This follows from the observation that $\lambda(1-\beta)$ is the net
  arrival rate, as jobs are lost at a rate $\lambda\beta$ . Hence, the
  load must be $\lambda(1-\beta)/\mu$. As the load must be equal to
  $\rho$, it follows that $\rho = \lambda(1-\beta)/\mu$, from which the
  other result immediately follows.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{extra}\clabel{ex:77}
  Consider a single-server queue at which every minute a customer arrives, precisely at the first second.
  Each customer requires precisely $50$ seconds of service.
  What are $\rho$, $\E L$, $C_a^2$, and $C_S^2$?
\begin{solution}
    $\rho = \lambda \E S = 1/60 \cdot 50 = 5/6$.
    Since job arrivals do not overlap any job service, the number of jobs in the system is 1 for $50$ seconds, then the server is idle for 10 seconds, and so on.
    Thus $\E L = 1\cdot5/6 = 5/6$.
    There is no variance in the inter-arrival times, and also not in the service times, thus $C_a^2 = C_s^2 = 0$.
    Also $\E{W_Q}=0$ since $\E{L_Q}=0$.
    Interestingly, we get the same from Kingman's formula.
\end{solution}
\end{extra}

\begin{exercise}\clabel{ex:76}
  Consider the same single-server system as in~\cref{ex:76}, but now the customer service time is stochastic: with probability $1/2$ a customer requires $1$ minute and $20$ seconds of service, and with probability $1/2$ the customer requires only $20$ seconds of service.
  What are $\rho$, $C_a^2$, and $C_S^2$?
\begin{solution}
 Again $\E S$ is 50 seconds, so that $\rho = 5/6$. Also
      $C_a^2=0$. For the $C_S^2$ we have to do some work. 
      \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
          \E S &=  \frac{20}2 + \frac{80}2 = 50 \\
          \E{S^2} &=  \frac{400}2 + \frac{6400} 2 = 3400 \\
          \V S &=  \E S^2 - (\E S)^2 = 3400 - 2500 = 900 \\
          C_S^2 &=  \frac{\V S}{(\E S)^2} = \frac{900}{2500}=\frac{9}{25}.
        \end{split}
      \end{equation*}
\end{solution}
It is crucial to remember from the above exercises that knowledge of the   utilization is not sufficient to characterize the average queue   length.
\end{exercise}

\begin{extra}
  For the $G/G/1$ queue, prove that the fraction of jobs that see $n$ jobs in the system is the same as the fraction of departures that leave $n$ jobs behind.
  What condition have you used to prove this?
%\item Motivate that for  the $G/M/1$, $\delta(n) = p(n)$, i.e.,  departures see time averages. 
\begin{solution}
    All follows straightaway from the definitions in the main text.
    In the $G/G/1$ queue jobs arrive and depart in single units.
    Hence, $|A(n,t)-D(n,t)|\leq 1$, cf.,~\cref{eq:19}.
    Then,
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{A(t)}{t}\frac{A(n,t)}{A(t)} \approx 
      \frac{D(t)}{t}\frac{D(n,t)}{D(t)}. 
    \end{equation*}
    The left-hand side goes to $\lambda \pi(n)$ as $t\to\infty$, and
    the right-hand side to $\delta \delta(n)$. Use the fact that we
    always assume, implicitly, that the system is stable, so that
    $\lambda = \delta$. As a consequence $\delta(n) = \pi(n)$.
\end{solution}
\end{extra}


\begin{exercise}\clabel{ex:91}
  (Hall 5.19) When a bus reaches the end of its line, it undergoes a
  series of inspections. The entire inspection takes 5 minutes on
  average, with a standard deviation of 2 minutes. Buses arrive with
  inter-arrival times uniformly distributed on $[3,9]$ minutes.

As a first case,  assuming a single server, estimate $\E{W_Q}$ with the $G/G/1$ waiting time formula. As a second case, compare this result to an $M/G/1$ system with arrival rate 10 per hour and the same service time distribution. Explain why your previous answer is smaller. 
\begin{solution}
First the $G/G/1$ case. Observe that in this case, the inter-arrival time $X\sim U[3,9]$, that is, never smaller than 3 minutes, and never longer than 9 minutes. 

\begin{pyconsole}
  
a = 3.
b = 9. 
EX = (b+a)/2. # expected inter-arrival time
EX
labda = 1./EX # per minute
labda
VA = (b-a)*(b-a)/12.
CA2 = VA/(EX*EX)
CA2

ES = 5.
sigma = 2
VS = sigma*sigma
CS2 = VS/(ES*ES)
CS2

rho = labda*ES
rho

Wq = (CA2+CS2)/2. * rho/(1.-rho) * ES
Wq
\end{pyconsole}

Now  the $M/G/1$ case.

\begin{pyconsole}
Wq = (1.+CS2)/2. * rho/(1.-rho) * ES
Wq
\end{pyconsole}

The arrival process with uniform inter-arrival times is much more
regular than a Poisson process. In the first case, bus arrivals are
spaced in time at least with 3 minutes.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}



Clearly, Sakasegawa's equation requires an estimate of the SCV $C_a^2$ of the inter-arrival times and the SCV $C_s^2$ of the service times.
Now it is not always easy in practice to determine the actual service time distribution, one reason being that service times are often only estimated by a planner, but not actually measured.
Similarly, the actual arrival moments of jobs are often not registered, mostly just the date or the hour, perhaps, that a customer arrived.
Hence, it is often not possible to estimate $C_a^2$ and $C_s^2$ from the information that is available.
However, when for instance the number of arrivals per day has been logged for some time so that we know $\{a_n, n=1,\ldots, N\}$ for some $N$, we can use this information instead of the inter-arrival times $\{X_k\}$ to obtain insight into $C_a^2$.
The relation we present here to compute $C_a^2$ from $\{a_n\}$ can of course also be applied to estimate $C_s^2$.

\begin{theorem} The SCV of the inter-arrival times can be estimated
  with the formula
\begin{equation*}
C_a^2 \approx \frac{\tilde \sigma^2}{\tilde \lambda},
\end{equation*}
where 
\begin{equation*}
\tilde  \lambda = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac 1n  \sum_{i=1}^n a_i,\quad  
\tilde  \sigma^2 = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 - \tilde \lambda^2.
\end{equation*}
In words, $\tilde \lambda$ is the average number of arrivals per period, e.g., per day, and $\tilde \sigma^2 $ is the variance of the number of arrivals per period.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  The proof is based on an argument in \cite{cox62:_renew_theor}.
  We use quite a bit of the notation developed in~\cref{sec:rate-stability}.
  Let $\{A(t), t\geq 0\}$ be the number of arrivals that occur up to (and including) time $t$.
  We assume that $\{A(t)\}$ is a renewal process such that the inter-arrival times $\{X_k, k=1, 2, \ldots\}$ with $X_k = A_{k}-A_{k-1}$, are i.i.d.
  with mean $1/\lambda$ and standard deviation~$\sigma$.
  (Observe that $\sigma$ is not the same as $\tilde \sigma$ above.)
  Note that $C_a^2$ is defined in terms of $\lambda$ and $\sigma$ as:
\begin{equation*}
C_a^2 = \frac{\V{X_i}}{(\E{X_i})^2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{1/\lambda^2} = \lambda^2 \sigma^2.
\end{equation*}

Next, let $A_k$ be the arrival time of the $k$th arrival.
The following useful relation between $A(t)$ and $A_k$ enables us to prove our result (recall that we used a similar relation in the derivation of the Poisson process):
\begin{equation*}
\P{A(t) < k} = \P{A_k > t}.
\end{equation*}

Since the inter-arrival times have finite mean and second moment by assumption, we can apply the central limit law to obtain that, as $k\to\infty$,
\begin{equation*}
\frac{A_k -k/\lambda}{\sigma \sqrt k} \to N(0,1),
\end{equation*}
where $N(0,1)$ is a standard normal random variable with
distribution $\Phi(\cdot)$.  Similarly,
%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{A(t) -\lambda t}{\alpha \sqrt t} \to N(0,1)
\end{equation*}
for an $\alpha$ that is yet to be determined. Thus,
$\E{A(t)} = \lambda t$ and $\V{A(t)}=\alpha^2 t$.

Using that $\P{N(0,1) \leq y} =
\P{N(0,1) > -y}$ (and $\P{N(0,1)=y} = 0$) we have that
%
\begin{align*}
\Phi(y) &\approx \P{\frac{A_k - k/\lambda}{\sigma \sqrt k }\leq y} \\
        &= \P{\frac{A_k - k/\lambda}{\sigma \sqrt k} >  -y} \\
        &=  \P{A_k >  \frac k\lambda - y \sigma \sqrt k}.
\end{align*}
Define for ease
\begin{equation*}
t_k = \frac{k}\lambda - y \sigma \sqrt k.
\end{equation*}
We can use the above relation between the distributions of~$A(t)$
and~$A_k$ to see that~$\P{A_k >t_k } = \P{A(t_k) <k}$. With this we
get,
\begin{align*}
\Phi(y)
        &\approx  \P{A_k >  t_k } \\
        &=  \P{A(t_k) <  k } \\
        &=  \P{\frac{A(t_k) - \lambda t_k}{\alpha \sqrt{t_k}} < 
\frac{k-\lambda t_k}{\alpha \sqrt{t_k}}}.
\end{align*}
Since $(A(t_k) - \lambda t_k)/ \alpha \sqrt{t_k} \to N(0,1)$
as $t_k \to \infty$, the above implies that
\begin{equation*}
\frac{k-\lambda t_k}{\alpha \sqrt{t_k}} \to y,
\end{equation*}
as $t_k \to \infty$.  Using the above definition of $t_k$, the left
hand of this equation can be written as
\begin{equation*}
\frac{k-\lambda t_k}{\alpha \sqrt{t_k}} =
\frac{\lambda \sigma \sqrt k }{\alpha \sqrt{k/\lambda + \sigma\sqrt k}} y.
\end{equation*}
Since $t_k \to \infty$ is implied by (and implies)
$k\to\infty$, we therefore want that $\alpha$ is such that
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\lambda \sigma \sqrt k }{\alpha \sqrt{k/\lambda + \sigma\sqrt k}} y \to y,
\end{equation*}
as $k\to\infty$. This is precisely the case when
\begin{equation*}
\alpha = \lambda^{3/2}\sigma.
\end{equation*}
Finally, for $t$ large (or, by the same token $k$ large),
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\sigma_k^2}{\lambda_k} = \frac{\V{A(t)}}{\E{A(t)}} \approx \frac{\alpha^2 t}{\lambda t} 
= \frac{\alpha^2}{\lambda} = \frac{\lambda^3\sigma^2}{\lambda} = \lambda^2 \sigma^2 = C_a^2,
\end{equation*}
where the last equation follows from the above definition of $C_a^2$.
The proof is complete.
\end{proof}
